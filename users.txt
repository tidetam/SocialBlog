It takes Markov model, the effect of transfer locality adjustment, etc. into consideration, which opens new ways for insightful, computationally efficient SNA.Based on EC(entropy centrality), an algorithm for community detection in networks which iteratively removes high-betweenness edges in an hierarchical clustering procedure was designed. Clusters result for the Dolphin network is demonstrated below. I suppose it can be used in project.EC\u00a0is well-interpretable using matrix multiplication which can be further adopted in recommendation systems, network visualization and detecting implicit overlapping network communities.",

We can use both AI and non-AI techniques to do data mining. NLP is a field in itself but some consider it a part of AI. It deals only with processing language, to different ends like Human-Computer Interaction, Data analysis and many other applications. ML is the study of techniques to make computers learn to solve different problems. This technique depends on the context and can be applied in other fields (like DM, NLP).",

That is the recommender system. The most widespread recommender system we can see is the advertisement recommendation on the or the on the Weibo pages or WeChat application. Such applications or websites deal with the social network of each application users. For example, there is a famous star like Jay Chou who has a huge amount of fans, which means he has \u00a0high centrality. If someone who follows his Weibo , the Weibo will introduce some relevant purchase for fans like new album or new concert information.Last semester, we had attempted to design a news recommender system, we collect data from Quora community about the interested vector of targeted users. According to the Interested vectors, we can calculate the similarity between users, if one users like one news, we will introduce the same news to other users who have high similarity with the first user.",

Commonly, a spider is used widely in crawling data.\u00a0Data crawling are more related to our course, since we focus on the sentiment analysis and we need collect some key words information from the websites.Data is a technique in which a computer program extracts data from human-readable output coming from another program.

Processor need to train dataset beforehand with this method.And for unsupervised learning, it don\u2019t need the output of some instances, however, data classifier will group the input data into different clusters.

But now, after the Matebook comes up, I know what I though before it\u2019s really a fantasy. Honestly, the technology of Huawei cannot show up though the birth of Matebook. Since the most technology parts, for example, the CPU, the Operating System, the Hard Disk and the Memory, are still using the technology of Microsoft and Intel, it can be said that Huawei have no contribution to the new PC, at least not in technology part.Therefore, someone said Matebook is just a \u201cHome Built Computer\u201d, since its technology has no difference from Lenovo.\u00a0Though, that\u2019s to be expected. Since the operating module of Huawei is first following, then uses its low cost or advertisement to exceed its enemies. I have to admit that this method can really bring high profit to Huawei but Microsoft leads and you just follow, Microsoft leads and you just copy, how can you really exceed Microsoft one day.

And in Zhihu, the first thing to do as a new user is to follow some famous user(\u201cV-user\u201d, who has large amount of follows and has lots of voting contents).After opening its gate by 2013, Zhihu are gaining more and more success these years.

Using these dictionary, we can get a normalised score for each sentence. Then, we can classify this sentence as positive, negative or neutral.\nFor example, dictionary = {like:+1,bad:-1, worth:+1, boring,-1}\nI like this movie => score =+1 => positive\nThis coffee taste bad => score=-1 =>negative\nThis movie is boring but still worth to watch it =>score = 0 =>neutral",

It is a easy way to carry out unsupervised learning.\nHowever, as K-Means Clustering does not have a fixed solution. The comparison of similarity can be done with getting different features. Thus, the accuracy for clustering can be enhanced with getting suitable features of the data set.\nAnother classification method is Naive Bayes Text Classification. This classification method classifies the text by calculating the possibility that words belong to a group. The accuracy is also the problem to enhance.",

            "content": "In Lecture 6, we have studied a story about Twitter Mood and Stock Market. In China, the first sentiment-stock analysis software (http://www.stockradar.net) has been available for more than three years. The data of mood stock market index is from Sina Finance, Sohu Finance, even Weibo etc., and use their own algorithm program to extract the key elements of the core social data, then identify key indicators such as \u201cups, downs and sale\u201d, come out the predicted value of most investors to Stock Market.I am very interested in what algorithm program they use to analysis the text words of Weibo. Because of the complexity of people\u2019s language, it will be a very hard job. For example, Handling Negation is a process shows us that \u2018very good\u2019 and \u2018not good\u2019 should be treated differently and particularly. Some complicated Chinese grammar such as \u2018metaphor\u2019,\u2019 Innuendo \u2018 will also be difficult to analysis. There are two important Weibo Mood analysis dictionary (Weibo emoticon dictionary \u2018EmoDic\u2019 and Chinese emotional dictionary \u2018SixDic\u2019) to identify six emotions which Weibo expressed: happy, sadness, anger, fear, evil, scared. The dictionary-based method is an obvious advantage of Weibo Mood Analysis, even\u00a0Oxford Dictionary released \u00a0emoticon \u201cCried with Smile\u201d as the\u00a02015 annual word.In the end of this blog, I will put a picture of U.S. Mood Throughout the Day inferred from Twitter to show how clearly Twitter and Weibo Mood expressed our life.

When entropy centrality of the starting entity is high, then nodes on the flow seem to stop at anywhere with equal probability so that it\u2019s difficult to predict the destination of flow. Otherwise, if entropy centrality of it is relative low, the probabilities of each node being the end of flow have quite large differences.Conversely, when the probability of each node seems to be equal or has few distinction in one network, the entropy centrality of the beginning of it seems to be high. And one network with maximum of entropy centrality will told to be with maximum of centrality(e.g. star network).\u00a0",

Because of basis on Shannon\u2019s information theory, \u00a0it was named \u201centropy\u201d centrality. In Shannon\u2019s information theory, information can be measured by uncertainty, or entropy, it indicates the amount of randomness or range of choice, if there is much randomness and plenty of choice, then information is high. Information in a system can be described in a mathematic method by this formula: H = \u2013 \u2211( pi)(log\u00a0pi), that is related to transmitted symbols\u2019 probability\u00a0pi.\u00a0",

If you are interested in a restaurant, you can browse the reviews about it to decide whether you should go for it or what food you must try. As it is difficult to cater for all tastes, people from different places have different appetites.So you can put focus on comments from customers whose hometowns are same or near to yours for reference, thus you can make a relatively good and right decision.",

Different language used different characters to write, so it\u2019s hard to figure out complicated website comments used a lot of languages, but the emojis are unicode graphic symbols used ASCII show some meaning on our social media, like twitter or whatsapp.Each emoji have it unique means, positive or negative so we can use the triangle \uff1a3-valued variable c \u2208 {\u22121, 0, +1} \u00a0to evaluate both the emoji\u2019s sentiments and the outline sentiment of the sentence. Do a briefly classification.

Most of us will follow other\u2019s decision \u2013 give a 5 stars.But, if the average rate is 3.5, we will give a higher score than average but few of us will give a 5 stars.

In addition, every method have degree and potential index.Degree centrality means that if a point has a lot of indirect relatives in the social network, the point is in the central. It uses in-degree and out-degree to represent the DC, the in-degree is regarded as the degree of popularity and the out-degree is the degree of gregarious.Betweenness centrality is the number of the shortest path. Closeness centrality is the degree of dependence of a point to other point. Eigenvector centrality is based on the relative index, the connection of high index point is more important than the low index point.",

For supervised learning, the main task is to train a classifier from training data with labels, and then the classifier is used to determine labels for new examples. The main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is that no labels are provided for unsupervised learning, and thus the evaluation of a solution is not applicable.Lexicon-based approach contains dictionary-based approach and corpus-based approach. These two approaches determine the sentiment by checking the opinions words appeared.",

It aims at determining the attitude or opinion of the opinion holder about a particular entity (such as a product, a topic, a service, etc.).Polarity of words are highly depended upon in current tools and algorithms. However, the words may mean totally oppositely in a different sentence context. What\u2019s worse, sarcasms and ironies can make it extremely difficult for current models to determine the sentiment.

This technique allows computer programs to improve themselves automatically when encountering new data. As a result, instead of traditionally human communicating with computers in a programing language, with NLP computers can analyze and understand human speeches easily, even the different meanings of the same word or sentence in different contexts.",

Social network can be devided into explicit social network and implicit social network. We can use graph to represent relationship in social network. Graph has three important concepts: Degree\u00a0 centrality, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality. Betweenness centrality is used to measure the importance of an actor in a social network. There are two dimensions for information flow processes in a social network: transmission dimension and trajectory dimension. The transmission dimension distinguishes whether diffusion occurs via transfer or replication. The trajectory dimension concerns whether the traffic flows non-deterministically.We use graph clustering to detect communities in social network. In last semester, I have learned a lot of knowledge in machine learning, so in this course I will apply the knowledge to solve practical problems.",

The fact is that to build a solid and robust analysis system, we need to combine both human and machine techniques, which covers reliability, reproducibility, scale and aslo accuracy in quality in niche topics. After obtaining and preparing data to be analyzed, word histograms, normative collections and non-word analysis will be used to perform vocabulary analysis.And Natural Language Processing focuses on understanding and generating natural language.

Generally, there are two kinds of Machine learning modes, Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning. In Supervised Learning, we first teach program how to process input data with specific examples, then program can handle new input data with patterns learnt previously. While in Unsupervised Learning, instead of teaching program how to deal with data, we let program find hidden patterns behind large amount of data itself, then we analyze these found patterns and try to find out useful information within them. Nowadays, there also emerges a new trend of Semi-Supervised Machine Learning, which combines all these advantages of both Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning.",

These attributes of graph can reveal different meaning when the graph represents social media.

Some of you may be very strange with Python and feel confused, I highly recommend the course \u201cUsing Python to Access Web\u201d in Coursera \u2013 https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data.I think its content is well designed and easy-following.

It means that in any trajectory, it always takes the best way such as the shortest distance called geodesic. Four different kinds of trajectories are classified according to their features. The second one is entropy centrality, which refers to a flow beginning at a specific node, the centrality of that node is related to the distribution of the probabilities that the flow stops at each of the nodes in the network.",

The project is nearly the same with the asg-1. There are two differences between these two jobs. The 1st one is the database we use and the 2nd one is the model(classifier) we selected.

An important application of in-degree centrality is to measure the truthfulness of a webpage. (PageRank)Closeness centrality of a vertex is the inverse of the summation of shortest distance from this vertex to all other vertices. It can be used in genealogy construction.Entropy centrality is characterized by path-based transfer flows. It measures the distribution of the probabilities that the flow stops at each of the vertices in the network. Centrality is low when the choices of flows are highly constrained and vice versa.",

Such as Weibo, it often appears new \u00a0words or deformation words. When there is no definition of these words, this method cannot calculate.2.Machine learning approachAdvantages: It overcomes the influence of the unknown words and easily converts text into structured data for processing. After classification, it can select features according to the needs through\u00a0classifier structured by the training set.Disadvantages: it views all the characters as isolated elements, and cannot reflect the text connection and structure.

So, the main mission is to recognize the sentiment.However, most of reviews tend to refer to differ aspects/attributes and may have a different orientation to different entities in practice, such as \u201cThe food was great but the service was awful\u201d. Besides, we also probably face a problem: the evaluation of properties not in the sentence, which is a very common phenomenon. At this time, combining with the context is required, as the figure shows below. In addition, there is a lot more complicated situation required us to specific analysis.Through analysis, we can gain many useful information like behavior prediction, therefore, sentiment analysis and opinion mining needs deep refinement to contribute to society.",

So MCL,\u00a0 is actually a fast unsupervised clustering algorithm, which mainly based on Random Walk and Markov chain. The main idea of MCL is to random walk one point, and then when the cluster become dense, the walking point would not leave the cluster easily. So the first part of MCL is the ordinary random walk, the second part of MCL is actually based on the characteristics of no following effects in the Markov Chain. Backwardly, MCL is actually amending one transition probability matrix performing Expansion and Inflation. The main focus of these two performing is to make the neighbor points connect to each other stronger, thus to form a cluster.",

Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm,\u00a0 basically speaking, finds the minimum of the total sum of weights in an undirected graph. Dijkstra algorithm, is one algorithm finding the minimum distinction from one point to another point in a graph. Topological Order algorithm is a little hard to understand, since it contains basic knowledge of topology. What it perform is to list all the points by a linear order\u00a0 in a Directed Acyclic Graph. Critical Path Method is a practical algorithm created by DuPont chemistry company. What it mainly concerns about is how much time is one specific project cost, and those key activities in it, which generally combines Dijkstra algorithm with Topological Order algorithm, to make the whole project performs in a short time and efficiently.",

We commonly use Degree centrality, Betweenness centrality and Closeness centrality to index the nodes\u2019 activity, measure the nodes\u2019 control and they communicational efficiency to know their centrality.Another important method is to compute the entropy of each nodes to measure the importance of it. Instead of finding the importance of geodesics of each nodes,we assume a information flow start from a specific node, then summary the probability that the flow stop at each node to get their centrality. If there is much freedom of choice to go through the next adjacent nodes, this node would be thought to have high centrality. The peak value of centrality of a node appear when the probability to travel to the next nodes are equal and its go with increasing N.Through running these centrality measurement on social network, we can find out the important actors from the complex network and understand much clearly about how the social network works.",

Combing the index and the rise or fall of gas\u00a0price, it\u2019s possible to determine relations between gas price and people\u2019s sentiment.Also, it seems that sentiment analysis can be applied to analyze whether Frank Underwood is having a worse image than his wife, to test names of anti-depressants for five-year-olds or what color cross trainers soccer moms will drool over. These applications remind me of using sentiment analysis to do stock price prediction, which is even more interesting.",

However, most of the supervised learning algorithms have good effects while the results of clustering are not so well. On the one hand, take the study process of middle school students for the example. If students don\u2019t know the correct answers after each exams, they may not be able to absorb the knowledge very well. On the other hand, supervised learning costs too much. So, semi-supervised learning are more and more popular nowadays.",
